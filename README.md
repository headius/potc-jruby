# Prelude of the Chambered (JRuby port)

This is an in-progress JRuby port of notch's 48 hour "Ludum Dare" game competition entry, _Prelude of the Chambered_.

Notch's Java code is pretty straightforward and I've been looking for an excuse to do a "real" project in JRuby for ages. This seemed an ideal opportunity.

Porting is still in progress but the first few minutes of the game are playable, to a point. Doors don't seem to animate properly but you can go through them once opened, nonetheless.

Controls are W, A, S, D and space. Or arrow keys. To get started, turn around and punch the "broken" wall. Best place to head is along the corridor, to the left, and down into the dungeon. You'll find boulders to punch, magic gloves, and bats to kill down there.

## Running

To run this code, get JRuby installed (rvm install jruby?) and then just run (from the root folder):

    ruby escape.rb
