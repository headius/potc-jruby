# Prelude of the Chambered (JRuby port)

This is an in-progress JRuby port of notch's 48 hour "Ludum Dare" game competition entry, _Prelude of the Chambered_.

Notch's Java code is pretty straightforward and I've been looking for an excuse to do a "real" project in JRuby for ages. This seemed an ideal opportunity.

Porting is still in progress and I'm only as far as the main menu so far. But a lot of "support" code has already been ported so progress is going well.

## Running

To run this code, get JRuby installed (rvm install jruby?) and then just run (from the root folder):

    ruby escape.rb

## License

Unsure as yet, not sure of the license for the original game.
